        <p class="lead mb-4">This is Cathy Luu. She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2001. She moved to El Monte, California when she was around three years old. She attended Wilkerson Elementary School, Columbia Middle School, and El Monte High School. She is currently a first-year student attending the University of California, Riverside as a Pre-Business major.
<br><br>

        In high school she was involved in the organization ‚ÄúFuture Business Leaders of America‚Äù. In that organization, she was able to prepare for careers in business through academic competitions, leadership development, and educational programs. She has volunteered for American Red Cross and Key Club. Some events she has volunteered for are marathons, blood drives, and toy drives. She was also a part of her school‚Äôs Associated Student Body where she held the positions of Commissioner of Fundraising and Commissioner of Student Recognition. Her role as Commissioner of Fundraising consists of making sure fundraiser requests, amendments, and purchase orders got approved or disapproved weekly, based on the sales analysis and dates. She then organized and managed all fundraisers onto a calendar for record and future references. As Commissioner of Student Recognition, she planned assemblies that recognized students‚Äô academic and athletic achievements. Through the experience of assuming those positions, she was able to learn more about the importance of accuracy and organization. Furthermore she participated in athletics, such as tennis, where she was Captain and played Doubles, and track, where she did long and high jump. As Captain, her duty was to act as a bridge between the coach and her team members. She would communicate strategies and motivate her team through encouraging words. This allowed her to gain more experience and deepen her understanding of what it means to be a leader. Joining these organizations helped her develop new skills such as corporation, communication, and discipline. 
<br><br>

       Her current intended area of concentration,as a Pre-Business major, is Management. She is involved in the Vietnamese Student Association and the Hallyucr organization. Through these organizations, she has been able to network and connect with a diverse group of people.
